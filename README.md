This code allows you to create a custom Sound Node called __Cue Player__, which can play a Sound Cue inside the Sound Cue Editor. Feel free to use it in your UE4 projects. <br>
__IMPORTANT:__ Please remember to update the __'API'__ identifier in __SoundNodeCuePlayer.h__ to match your own project. My project was called _CustomAudioProject_, this is why there is a __CUSTOMAUDIOPROJECT_API__ identifier in the header's code.
